hbo,Last of us finale review.,"Spoilers.

It was probably the objectively worst episode in the show and it did exactly wrong what I thought they were going to do wrong.

Where do I even start?

Let's start with that hilarious woman giving birth without realising it lmfao. 

That scene has zero redeeming qualities. We dont need to know how Marlene found Ellie. It only diminishes the mystery.

Luckily this scene takes about 5/10 minutes in a finale that is only 45 minutes long and needs to wrap it all up within 30 minutes. /s

Then we get Joel acting like a lunatic fawning over Ellie out of nowhere. Pedro seems to have tossed all subtlety out of the window and doesnt nearly come close to the games rendition of Joel in this sequence.

Ellie meanwhile still carries the same one emotion on her face shes had the entire season.

The giraffe sequence.. Ugh.. The reason the game works is because it earns it. After all the terror and horror (yes, horror) you suddenly find yourself in a surreal situation. The show however has barely any horror or dread in it so this scene falls flat. 

Now the hospital sequence. Dead lord. This is just amateuristic filmmaking. Rarely have I seen a shootout filmed so incredibly boring. It's more like a montage than a scene, really. Almost like they have only 10 more minutes to wrap things up.

Also Joel doesnt even save ellie from drowning like he does in the game. Imagine having amazing set pieces right. We dont want that.

 Now the ending. Jesus christ the ending. Everything about it fails. The choice Joel makes takes about one second. The audience when playing the game surely took longer to ponder what to do here. Not so much for Joel, hes now just a killing machine (nevermind him almost losing a fight and crying about how weak he is to his brother)

This show was a massive disappointment and I feel sorry for anyone watching this and thinking they've anything remotely resembling the original story. Glad to be done with it. It was interesting to see how they botched it up, quite the journey."

FADE IN:

INT. HIGH SCHOOL CLASSROOM - DAY

A group of students sit in a classroom, listening to a lecture on identity and self-expression.

TEACHER (voiceover) What is identity? Is it something we're born with, or is it something we create for ourselves?

The camera focuses on Rue (Zendaya) as she scribbles in her notebook, lost in thought.

CUT TO:

INT. RUE'S BEDROOM - DAY

Rue is lying in bed, staring at the ceiling, lost in thought.

RUE (voiceover) I used to think that my identity was fixed, like a tattoo. But now I realize it's more like alchemy. We're constantly changing, evolving, becoming something new.

She sits up and grabs her phone, scrolling through her social media feeds.

CUT TO:

INT. JULES'S BEDROOM - DAY

Jules (Hunter Schafer) is getting dressed, trying on different outfits in front of the mirror.

JULES (voiceover) I used to be afraid of my own reflection. But now I see it as a canvas, a way to express myself.

CUT TO:

INT. SCHOOL HALLWAY - DAY

Kat (Barbie Ferreira) and Maddy (Alexa Demie) are walking down the hallway, dressed in their most daring outfits.

KAT (voiceover) I used to hide behind baggy clothes, afraid of what people might say. But now I embrace my curves, my sexuality.

MADDY (voiceover) I used to think that beauty was only skin deep. But now I see it as something that comes from within.

The camera follows Rue as she walks through the hallway, observing her classmates.

RUE (voiceover) We all have our own stories, our own struggles. But together, we can create something beautiful.

CUT TO:

INT. SCHOOL AUDITORIUM - DAY

Rue, Jules, Kat, and Maddy stand on stage, dressed in their most daring outfits, facing a crowd of their classmates.

RUE (voiceover) We're not defined by our past, or by the labels that others give us. We're defined by who we choose to be, and the stories we tell about ourselves.

The crowd cheers as the four girls start to perform a dance routine.

CUT TO:

INT. RUE'S BEDROOM - NIGHT

Rue lies in bed, scrolling through her social media feeds once again.

RUE (voiceover) Identity is a work in progress, a journey that never ends. And I'm excited to see where it takes me next.

FADE OUT."

For example when we first see him hes more like Jesus or Moses trying to save his people and is kind and affectionate towards Ellie. Then as the episode goes on we see how he betrays Ellie just like Judas. Also at 11;11 this is when David introduces himself to Ellie. 11:11 is an angel number which is used as a warning in a way of potential danger. What do all of you think?

It would be like nothing else on television or streaming at the moment due to its original and quite unique narrative. 

It's set after World War 2 ended and something in Russia has broken out of the walled off country and infected all of the people in Europe quickly over night like a blink of an eye. British forces have quarantined Europe and stated no one would be allowed to leave or enter the environment due to this unknown infection/threat. The Americans and other countries such as Canada and South America have word about the situation but are not letting anyone in the civilian population know about it to avoid panic and fear. 

The Americans, Canadians and South American elite send out their troops to Europe for aid in the effort but do not tell them anything about the unknown threat to avoid loss of moral support and confidence to succeed in the task. 


It turns out that in Europe an alien race known as the ""Chimera"" are infecting civilians and anyone in their path, and taking them to the conversion camps during their induced comas to convert them and transform their body into more Chimeran troops to attempt to take over Earth. 


One man gets infected during a regular mission, as his squad winds up getting infected but he wakes up a few hours later to assume nothing happened to him. Unknown to him but the British forces who notice it in his eyes that he is infected but his body is fighting back the disease but giving him the regenerative capabilities and strength of the Chimera. He works to help the forces clear the Chimera off Europe and save everyone as best as he can. 


I think this could be an awesome TV series due to the fact that there's really no show that has this kind of premise or the fact that it's a unique alternate history alien invasion band of brothers esque series. There's a lot of storytelling and potential lore to expand upon in a TV series that a film could not do justice in such a short time effort."

Once in a while i can see a show with no problem, but the rest of the time every second is blocks of gray on the screen, low res and bad sound, this doesnt happen on any other platform (Netflix, Disney, Youtube, etc.). Can i do anything or does HBO have to fix their shit?"
hbo,Why are HBO movies shorter here in the EU?,"Ok, so i know its got to do with the framerate, but when i go to the exact same movie on netflix, netflix has the original time but hbo has the sped up one with more frames since im in EU. Can someone explain why netflix hasnt made their movies shorter aswell?"
hbo,Boardwalk Empire ‚Äî üëçüèºüëéüèº?,"Thinking about starting Boardwalk Empire, as I‚Äôve seen a few snippets &amp; they‚Äôve somewhat grabbed my attention. Over the years I‚Äôve watched a number of series/docus/etc. about Capone and the prohibition era‚Ä¶.&amp; the whole Gangster Mob scene is where it‚Äôs at, IF done right‚Ä¶ I do like Steve Buscemi, in some roles.. but it‚Äôs difficult for me to take him serious, due to the fact that he has played in so many comical roles, with the Happy Madison Productions team. However, the most recent of films that I‚Äôve watched with him, was Fargo..&amp; .. how can you NOT love Fargo?! 
(I was actually in Fargo, ND for my nieces 1st birthday, which prompted me to watch it‚Ä¶twice..lol) 

Also, Michael Shannon is excellent! His role as the Iceman Richard K was outstanding!

I‚Äôm pretty certain I‚Äôm going to give it a shot, regardless‚Ä¶ but, I‚Äôd still appreciate any feedback and what I can expect from it..

hbo,What's New on HBO Max in February 2023,
hbo,Episode 3 The Last of Us was‚Ä¶fine,"So I enjoyed the episode enough, I liked getting more story of Bill since we barely see him in the game, but I cannot stand Frank. Frank was a manipulative POS and didn‚Äôt deserve to be cried over as many people have done apparently. He forced his way into Bill‚Äôs story, forced a kiss onto him with no indication that was appropriate at all (yeah these two have been seemingly alone for years and any company might be good company, but still), went against Bill‚Äôs wishes to help conserve supplies and keep them alive, and then made Bill do the dirty work and kill him. Frank was selfish from the moment he appeared and was genuinely not a good person. In a situation that they‚Äôre in it‚Äôs better to not trust every person you meet so why did he let Joel and Tess in? Because he doesn‚Äôt think things through and needlessly puts his and Bill‚Äôs lives at risk. Then towards the end ‚Äúlove me the way I want you to‚Äù that line solidified my hatred for this character that is such a selfish, manipulative thing to say you‚Äôre going to put the person you supposedly love through that because you don‚Äôt want to do it yourself? I get that even if he killed himself Bill would still suffer, but he didn‚Äôt know bill was also going to kill himself (which also really pissed me off when Frank said he should be upset/against, whatever he said, that Bill was doing that) so making your partner kill you and then imagining that they‚Äôre going to go the rest of their life knowing they are the one that killed you is way worse than you doing it yourself. I cannot stand Frank and I wish that they had left him out completely and he does not have any redeeming factor to me. It‚Äôs just an emotionally abusive relationship portrayed as the best part of Bill‚Äôs life even though it shouldn‚Äôt be."
hbo,"""The Last of us"" show HBO show got the energy of a Life is Strange game.","I'm a huge fan of both Last of us and Life is Strange games. I love story driven games. But speaking of the energy of the said two franchise, there is a clear distinction I can't fully explain. One is ""energetic"" and later is ""slow paced"". I've seen all the 3 LOU episodes, and I respect the changes in certain story elements and character design, while retaining the original's core elements, LOVED the production design. 

Now speaking of the energy, it's very slow paced. Atleast I felt that. Long conversations with just slow walking, Joel just staring at the river for like 5 minutes, characters just staring at a scenery for couple of minutes. Also there is very less action. I get that it's a show, there's no need of gameplay elements, but so far I've not yet seen Joel shooting some random guys and clickers, even tho there was just a brief clicker scene where he had to shoot one. Episode 1 started with a banger, then it all slowed down. In the games, the cutscenes felt interesting to me because there was a very good pacing, the acting was good, overall more exciting. 

Also, I can't connect with Joel and Ellie in the show that much. Idk what it is, but there is something missing. Maybe upcoming episodes would fix this.

So, you can pretty much say I still prefer the game than the show."

hbo,Don‚Äôt understand the insane love for The Last of Us,"Probably gonna get a lot of flak for this but tell me what you think regardless - I just really cannot see how people are rating the last two episodes especially as 9 or 10 out of 10.  

The first thing to say is that the writing and character dynamics don't hold a candle to the game. They could have spent more time in episode 3 amplifying Ellie and Joel's relationship, but 80% of it was dedicated to characters who had no influence on the main duo or the main plot and most likely will not appear again. I concede Bill and Frank's story was well done, but it felt far more like a spinoff or simply a diversion too indulgent to even matter. And this is for a series that only has 9 episodes in it, mind you.

Like really think about it, if the game does not exist, based on the series alone, what have we actually gotten out of Joel and Ellie's dynamic? What do we know about how they feel about the world and each other? I understand we will get more of this later, but for a combined near 3 and a half hours running time thus far what I've seen isn't exactly enticing me for more from the two characters who currently feel quite bland.  
For me, the first episode did pretty well with the small scenes they used to this purpose but that's mostly because the scenes and dialogue were lifted straight from the game. After that first episode literally all Joel and Ellie have done is walk and discuss the lore of the virus, which again, why does this matter to the overall plot?

What made the game's story so great wasn't knowing how the virus began, Bill's backstory, or even the specifics of Joel and Ellie's backstory, it was the writers showing us what little the characters had to germinate a life worth living for themselves, i.e. the relationship the same spent almost all of its time endearing us to.  
For example, ask yourself, do you really need to know the ins and outs of what Tommy and Joel got up to in the past 20 years? Sure it would make for a fun side game or side series, but for the main game, did the writers and actors tell you all you needed to know and made you feel all you needed to with the main story alone? Yes. 

That's why it's called ""The Last of Us"" - it's not a question about what happened to the rest of us, it's about what the last of us now need to do going forward. 

Another sort of odd thing is that it seems like they're weirdly constraining the budget. The only time we saw clickers in their full glory was the scene in episode 2 (and glimpses of the horde at the end I suppose), which was really the only highlight of that episode (Tess' death was far better in the game).

And other than that, since then there's barely been any fights/shooting/action scenes/set pieces, or anything that made the game exciting. Any of this was in the first episode, especially the first half hour with his daughter, which I thought was clearly the best portion of the series so far. Episode 3 literally seems like it would have only cost a couple of hundred thousand. Granted, the production design is all excellent, but it seems like that and the actors‚Äô salaries is all the money has gone towards so far.

I promise, promise, I'm not shitting on the show for the sake of it, I'm just genuinely confused why this is getting such insane praise and 10/10 for every episode. I definitely think it's good, better than good in a lot of places, but nowhere near a masterpiece and nowhere near the quality of the game, even though that's what the reactions are reflecting.

Anyway I'm keen to read what you think I've been missing or what you got out of it. Cheers."

hbo,Once an Eagle miniseries reboot (?),"I have been listening to the audio book version of Once an Eagle (1968) by Anton Myrer, and frankly I don‚Äôt understand why with as well as Band of Brothers and The Pacific have done since they came out and with how supposedly popular Once an Eagle is in military leadership circles, why no one has gone to make a new miniseries again based on this book in the same style as these two successful miniseries.

While I was about 3/4 of the way through, I watched the 1976 miniseries with Sam Elliot. Now, although I am an easy person to please when it comes to movies and shows and can appreciate something for what it is, I must say that I don‚Äôt like how the 1976 miniseries was not very faithful to the book (Sam Damon‚Äôs actions which won him the Medal of Honor in the book are watered down; Courtney Massengale comes across to me as being much worse in the 1976 miniseries book; I conceive there is way too much condensing of the book events; they stop at WWII and do not continue into Part 5: Delta) but then, I also remember it‚Äôs 1976 and I understand why it was done the way it was.

While listening to the audio book, scenes from Paschendale, All Quiet on the Western Front, the two previously stated miniseries, and other films like The Thin Red Line began swarming my brain.

Who would watch this series if HBO made a new series that was extremely faithful to the book? Does anyone think it would be worth the time and effort, as in would todays audience enjoy it? Is it too long and complicated if a project? Would love to hear all of your thoughts."

The first episode was terrific and followed the first game very closely. Which makes me happy, but also a bit anxious for a season 2 because I doubt they will address the poor decisions made in the second game. 

So: Will you watch a season 2 if it follows the story of the second game?

I cant be the only one who finds it completely rediculous that HBO would make an **HBO original** and then remove it from HBO's services. That would be like Microsoft making an Xbox exclusive games and then saying ""nevermind you can only play it on the PlayStation."" It truly doesn't make any sense to me. The only place I can find the show now is on Amazon Prime Video, but on that platform each season costs 22 dollars to purchase which is absolutely rediculous considering that I would've gotten the same content before HBO dropped it for 8/mo. I would just love an explanation as to why a company would willingly let go of one of their own originals."

It‚Äôs directed and presented by Andrew Callaghan who has spent the last couple years traveling around the country in an RV. 

What started as interviews with innocuous weirdos evolved into covering QAnon rallies and anti-lockdown protests. This gave unique insight into the events of 2020 that led up to January 6th. The results are both humorous and shocking as well as highly entertaining."

hbo,There Are So Many Penises on Television. It‚Äôs Time for the Final Frontier.,
hbo,Live action TV series based on The Thran and Brothers War from the Magic the Gathering Story novels,"After finishing all the game of thrones series and House of the dragon tv series. As a magic the gathering player and reading the thran novel based on magic the gathering story lore and currently reading brothers war novel MTG lore has so much potential for an amazing live action tv adaptation that can be similar to Game of thrones. If HBO would pick this up and partner up with wizards of the coast and a decent amount of budget would be involved. 

Magic the gathering story and lore starting from the Thran novel depicts an ancient race of technologically advanced artificers or people who specialize in inventing or creating artifacts and automatons with the use of power stones in a world where magic and advanced technology thrive. It would be cool to see constructs and floating artifacts/ornithopters and automatons powers stones and one of the main protagonist/antagonist who is a charismatic eugenicist yawgmoth who conducts morally questionable experiments to help a city being ravaged by a plague caused by power stones infection which is what this civillization utilizes and how he capitalizes on being a savioyr to propel himself polictically and rise to power. This also has a great war where different races engage in and are wiped out by a device. It has lots of themes of political intrigue/plotting/advanced technology and concepts of exploitation of resources and manipulation  and war love and plague. There is also a discovery of a new plane of existence which holds a promise for treatment of those afflicted by the disease caused by power stone usage. It's an interesting novel for anyone who's interested it's author is J Robert King and it's title is the The Thran.

And anotheron TV adapatiom could be the sequek to this the brothers which is about 2 artificers prodity urza and mishra who had a falling out which eventually led to a war that changed their continent forever these series could eventually introducing the concept of planeswalking a power/ability of people whos ""spark"" has awakened opening up to possibilities on developing more spin off series on the various planes and story arcs and legendary characters of Magic the Gathering"

Season 4 was so fucking stupid and so much shit happened that made absolutely no sense.

Each story line had its own compelling narrative, with the girls finding their place at Essex. This season idk seems off to me? Like the characters seem very one dimensional, and all of the plot points are very inconsequential. The girls all act extremely out of character and actresses that shined last season (Rene√© Rapp I love you.) seem uncomfortable delivering their lines and do so half-heartily. The jokes seem outdated, all of the quippy one liners and then a scene jump to another plot I don‚Äôt care about with Kimberly and some eye candy white man. (I miss Nico though he turned out to be garbage. He at least had some flavor. Even though this season has more development for side characters to shine: Lila, Canaan,  (the other queer POC from Whitney‚Äôs soccer team) I feel like they just get buffered into social situations to make the conversations seem more inclusive even though the subjects they cover are no longer about interpersonal relationships, but instead the racial and economic inequalities that occur in private schools. Shocker! But it‚Äôs ok because the characters shrug it off and continue through pop songs and bad dialogue"

hbo,HBO or some other serious TV show producer,"Back in 2014 I remember a friend begging me to pick up ""Mass Effect"" after telling them I was tired of military themed games with bleak settings. I wanted something new, refreshing, and more ""optimistic"". I then searched YouTube for a playthrough and this was the first result.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DINdtTcvO-4

I was amazed by what I saw. It was unlike any game I have seen.

After that I rushed to GameStop and managed to get a copy for $20 bucks.

I remember failing hard at first become I didn't know how to play RPGs. I was going into areas with higher level enemies than my character. It made a quit the game for a small time but I went back and was determined to learn how to play the game because I loved the characters, story, and universe I was introduced to.

I ended up picking up the rest of the trilogy and the DLC.

Before that I was not interested in anything space or sci fi. I ended up searching for more experiences like that. I picked up some books of ""The Expanse"". I also bought a telescope and went stargazing throughout the Summer of 2014. I binge watched Babylon 5 and BSG.

I wondered why there wasn't any shows with space travel in them. Turns out I wasn't alone. .

https://web.archive.org/web/20141202022030/http://io9.com/5837047/why-we-need-more-space-adventures

Things are different now with the loads of ""Trek"" and ""Wars"" shows.

I enjoyed ""Andor"". I find most of the Trek shows bland.

However it would be nice if we could have something that is that is not Wars or Trek that is new, refreshing, exciting, and optimistic without bland looking aliens.

Sadly I don't think people would watch a show set in an optimistic version of our future.

We live in darker times now. Back during 2012-2014 I remember being so excited and optimistic about the future."

I frequently want to start the video over from the beginning because my kids like rewatching the same movies over and over.

Currently, I have to rewind the movie to get back to the beginning. However, it would be much more convenient if a ""restart program"" button existed so I didn't have to do the whole rewinding thing. 

The user process would be:
- I open the HBO Max app
- I select a movie from the ""continue watching"" list
- I pause the movie
- The pop-up menu has a button for ""restart"" somewhere on screen (along with the movie slider, the closed captioning, and play buttons)

This is not a dealbreaker for me, it would just be convenient. But I'd also note that every other streaming service I have contains a restart button like I've described."

hbo,Jeremy Irons Cast in HBO's Watchmen | I.G TV News,"As if he can't get enough of the live-action comic book life, actor Jeremy Irons has been cast in a lead role in Damon Lindelof's *Watchmen*. This places Irons with Regina King, Don Johnson, Tim Blake Nelson, Louis Gossett Jr., Adelaide Clemens and Andrew Howard.

Irons played Alfred Pennyworth in the DCEU, stealing each scene he played in, which is amazing due to the fact Ben Affleck's Batman usually stood in the shot.

As of now, there's no information on who Iron's could be playing as nobody's role has yet been revealed, and the fact that this is an entirely new version of the Watchmen makes it hard to actually say if the actual characters created by Alan Moore and Dave Gibbons are gonna to have actual roles. For example, the original story took place around the Vietnam war era, however, this show will take place in present day, but still in the same world.

There's currently no premiere date for the show.

It started when I noticed Avon Barksdale was reminding me of Robert Barathoen in a wierd way. like he built his empire over the twenty years before the show started but after the first season we dont get to see a whole lot of him. (until he get out but even then it's for less than a season)

Stringbell is like Tywin lannister, The Iron Hand of the King, running the drug regime while the king is preoccupied.

Funnily enough Littlefinger played by Aidan Gillen is like Mayor Carcetti (Aidan Gillen), both relied on their enemies fighting each other to rise in the world.

Is **Sam Tarly matching with Prezbaluski** since both were cowards that had to change to an easier job and locale just to stay safe (sorry Prez)

And after watching season 7 of GOT, **Ayra is definitely Snoop** of ""Chris and Snoop"" fame. Young lady Assassins with ice cold hearts and a flare for weapon disciplines.

Sooo Anyone got any others? should Chris be Grendry since Ayra is Snoop?   is Micheal the best contender for Jon Snow?

**Maybe that dude who kills you in prison and makes it look like you hung yourself is Varys or Jaqen Hagar?**

It's fun to think of ways they do match rather than ways they don't, obviously as that's the point of the game. and dont forget the Bunk!  ("" JIIiiiimmMMYY!"")"

Why? There are no other shows running on the network that compel me to want to keep paying $15 a month anymore. 

It's sad how much HBO has fallen from the start of this decade to now. Used to be my favorite network with a large assortment of great shows and specials to watch throughout each year. Now there's only 1 or 2 while the rest are just garbage. Movies were the other reason why I kept HBO around, but adding 1 new movie every Saturday just isn't competitive anymore in this market. Not to mention that 95% of the older movies they have in their offerings are either mediocre or are also available on competitor networks.

Youtube, Netflix, PS Vue, etc... every other service runs just fine and I'm on comcasts fastest speed. Conversely, if I watch this all on my ipad, on the same network via Wifi it runs just fine. It's only on my PC that it runs so poorly. So what's the deal?"
