netflix,I'm really trying to like Money Heist but the characters are so dumb...(spoilers),"Started watching this one a few days ago, it's very stylish and I was really getting into it. Until you start to notice some very dumb things. I've only finished up to episode 4, but it's getting harder to continue.

Starting with ep 1. In the end, the professor is supposed to be this genius, but he couldn't figure out that cops would likely shoot at armed robbers? Really? Was that such a stretch in their plan?


As for the robbers themselves, it's just one dumb decision after another. Revealing their faces to the hostages. Taking hostages outside for some fresh air, and then talking right next to the hostage that the girl was shot which lead to snipers shooting that guy.

The main lead being so unprofessional, that she just gets into a relationship with a kid that constantly jeopardizes the heist. You know there's something wrong when the psychotic yet rational / professional guy is the one you're rooting for.

I don't get it, were the characters intentionally written to be morons? If so, why would the professor choose these idiots for the job. You'd think being such a particular and detail focused person trying to pull of the biggest heist ever, he'd be pretty nitpicky over getting professional people on board.

I'm so confused right now, how is this show so highly rated?"

netflix,Why does Netflix (and other Studios) break and ruin so many originals?,Hi! I was just doing a rewatch of the Avatar the last airbender animated TV show. It is a stunning piece of art and the story and the whole world itself could have been the ideal source for future productions. However we all probably remeber the the live action movie was a huge flop. Now I saw that Netflix started to work on a new live action series. I first was excited but then saw that both creators of the original animated series soon left the production due to creative differences. This reminded me of the witcher netflix original with the lead actor leaving the show disapponted as well. So why is netflix and other studio interference ruining so many quality productions? Is it not in their interest to produce the best content possible?

I know Arrested Development was set to leave on March 14th, which was yesterday, but it's still here, but strangely without the OG cut of season 4.

Beyond that, they made it more of drama and pranks than survival, with these idiot bartenders and yoga instructors being like ""we're on a mission"" ""we're doing recon"" as they stand on a beach and basically just plan to stare at or or steal from camps.

I appreciate that Netflix is trying to broaden their material with international shows, but I like to watch TV in the background while multitasking. I can't stare at the screen and read subtitles the whole time.

netflix,"If they do another Castlevania show, I really hope they dial back the cursing, and lean into more iconic ""monster"" designs","I think the Castlevania show was *fine* (barring the last probably 10-15 minutes, which *holy shit* was that awful). There were definitely flashes of brilliance, and the animation particularly for the major combat sequences was absolutely stunning.

That said, I couldn't help but cringe at quite a bit of the dialogue. It felt like a kid in middle school *trying* to be cool and edgy by just swearing for the hell of it. It made sense for Trevor, as that seemed a genuine part of his personality, but for most of the other characters, it felt incredibly forced.

I also felt like the monster designs were kind of a dud, personally. They were just all random, vaguely-humanoid ""shapes"" than actual creatures or demons of any kind. I feel like I would've been more invested by more relatable ""monsters"", like skeletons, werewolves, gargoyles -- no need to reinvent the wheel. And hell, doing some Castlevania staples like Fleamen, or the various ""attractive women with monster parts"", possessed inanimate objects... I feel like there would just be more to latch onto. Maybe even just more ""cultists"" in general?

Like I said, besides that very tail end of the show, I actually enjoyed it well enough. But I think letting the dialogue be more organic, instead of *forcing* so much swearing, and also leaning into more iconic, traditional types of enemies, would go a long ways.

I'm also personally hoping if we get Simon Belmont, they lean more into a more ""warrior/barbarian"" sort of personality. I was always a huge fan of his original design, where he looks like some crazy buff nordic viking, which would be a far cry from Trevor. Which, I liked Trevor well enough, but definitely ready for a change of pace, personally."

netflix,[Curious] Netflix's In The Name of God: A Holy Betrayal- Is Jeong / Jung Myeong Seok 정명석 a common name in Korea?,"First time poster here and not Korean/unable to read or speak Korean. Unfortunately I was not able to post this on r/Korea to get more clarity.

Like many outside of Korea, I recently found out about Jung Myeong Seok (JMS) from *Netflix's* documentary In The Name of God: A Holy Betrayal. Curious to find out more, I simply googled ""Jung Myeong Seok netflix"" and majority of the search result on page 1 was related to a character named Jung Myeong Seok on the drama Extraordinary Attorney Woo (EAW). Articles about the cult leader/scum Jung Myeong Seok was buried in pages 2, 3, 4 where most people hardly ever access. Even on reddit, searching for posts on Jung Myeong Seok / JMS yields more content on the drama EAW than the cult leader and his ""church"".

After multiple searches, I found articles detailing how pervasive JMS followers are, with many in places of influence (e.g. KBS producer, translator etc).

Based on the Korean spelling that I found online, both JMS (cult) and JMS (Attorney Woo) have the same spelling 정명석.

Hence, I was wondering if Jeong / Jung Myeong Seok is a common name in Korea and this is purely a coincidence or could it be an attempt of closet JMS followers in the entertainment industry trying to conceal his name in western website searches?

And am I overthinking or is JMS (cult) not super known in Korea? Because to me, it's like an American sitcom having a supporting character named Charles Manson or Jeffrey Dahmer who just \*happen\* to have the same name as a really notorious criminal."

I can imagine this isn’t the only example either, I’d hate to think kids are watching this stuff that’s clearly for an adult audience. 
I understand the ratings aren’t followed religiously, and they are mostly there in an advisory capacity. Growing up, I would watch lots of shows/movies that I was technically “too young to watch” but it would always be within reason. 
If it was rated 18 then yeah there’d probably be some 13-15 year olds that would see it, but that’d probably be the youngest, with it being rated 15 much younger individuals may potentially be exposed to this, due to parents thinking it won’t be that bad for their kids to watch, etc. 
But hey, this is the same company that green lighted “Cuties” I highly doubt they really care about protecting children from exposure to inappropriate content.

TL;DR: Why isn’t Better Call Saul Age Rated 18, instead of 15?"

I literally feel there is nothing new for months... I personally have noticed that it started since the new price onwards. Netflix is meant to be about choice. It's called on demand streaming for a reason. 

I've been literally watching only shows that were BBC and Channel 4 productions. What's the point in that?

netflix,Netflix loses sound on SmartTV in one room when computer in another room is turned on...?,"My brother is claiming that every time he is watching Netflix and I turn my computer on in a completely different room, it cuts off the sound of Netflix.

I tried to search and saw people had issues with the sound cutting out with Samsung SmartTVs when starting a new episode but he said it is happening abruptly. He does in fact have a Samsung tv though.

For reference our internet speed is around 250-290 Mbps so I don't think it is a bandwidth issue and he claims it is happening as soon as my computer is on, even before I can even *do* anything which probably isn't even enough to cause problems anyway.

My computer is connected through ethernet and I disabled/not connected the wifi and bluetooth on my computer even prior to him saying this since I never use them.

For my computer sound it is set to ""Speakers"" (Realtek High Definition Audio) and going through my headset. Even checking sound devices the only things that show up are 2 VoiceMeeters, 1 for my monitor, and then the ""Speakers"". For input devices it's 2 VoiceMeeter and Microphone (Realtek HD Audio). So I don't think my computer is taking over his TV sound either.

For reference I have never even used Netflix on my computer that I could even think would interrupt whatever he is doing.

I honestly don't understand what could be causing it. He says it's happening every weekend, since that's when he's off work and watching Netflix I guess, and by the time I wake up and turn on my computer he says it keeps happening.

I'll have to troubleshoot it myself when he's at work one day but I'm curious to know if anyone has ever heard of this happening before or what may be the cause? It seems like a crazy coincidence to me but again he says it keeps happening."

I saw 2 films lately from 2 diff directos. One was so bad that i couldnt finish it. The other had so many flaws in the story that i dont want to watch another show from him.

By bad i mean these directors did not put any effort on making the story credible. Several big  flaws that could have been fixed with minor explanations like:
- a sheriff that had no radio and was alone in the woods: his radio could have been damaged out of repair, but no... he just had no radio and nobody even questions that (neither the director lol..)
- 2 ppl running from bandits simply sleep on the car of a stranger that was helping them, and the strager was a bandit...: why did they sleep? That is never explained... they just sleep..........

These directors just miss the super ultra obvious things... so watching their contemt is a waste of time...

netflix,MH370 Docuseries - What a terrible series,"I can really only blame myself for continuing to watch this sensationalist garbage.   
I know I don't like this style of documentary, one based more on opinion, speculation, and conspiracy than actual fact, but I was bored and it was the first thing I picked. 

First off the repeated theories.   
The Journalist who starts off the series with an entirely speculative, circumstantial frankly imaginative scenario involving the pilot and a play by play of what happened, bookended by 'this is the only way this could have occurred is if this sequence of events happened exactly as I described' (not verbatim)... righhhht  
He simply HAD to publish this theory, he exclaims how he has a responsibility, he must do this!!

Cut to some episodes later when the wider public are disagreeing with the notion of the pilot having anything to do with the mystery, coupled with data from the MRSAT, and a second Malaysian Airlines tragedy, new theories were coming to light.. and this journalist could not miss out on the action. 

He reappears to meticulously paint out his next scenario, an entirely different one to the first, whereby a couple Russians on the plane accessed the MRSAT, shut off the communications, and then... somehow.. were able to control the plane using the MRSAT...Again he says, he has to publish this!!

He embarks once again and a nice little self promo tour giving interviews touting his nonsense. Meanwhile those who actually know the ins and outs of the MRSAT start debunking key points of his theory, the key ones being

1. They have NEVER used the MRSAT data to track the location of an airplane before. This was the first instance of this occurring, which is pretty evident in how long it took to collate and translate the data.   
With this in mind.. why would these supposed Russians go to all this effort to turn of a machine that is inconsequential to them with minimal tracking capabilities. 

2. This machine stayed on for a further 6hrs after the main comms cut out, which speaks for itself. 

3. You categorically cannot control the flight of an airplane from the communications area in question, so again, whats the point?

The smugness of this dude touting his theories and using it to get attention, only for this to be given more attention with him as a key narrator for most of the series, spreading false information and conspiracy theories. 

This whole series is purely speculation by people who are more interested in fame and notoriety or at the very leas want to be 'the one' to figure it all out.

The reality is whatever occurred is a mystery to the general public and we may never know the truth. 

Whilst I don't have an issue with forming theories and ideas, especially surrounding such a strange and mysterious incident, it's only natural to want to form answers to gain some level of understanding. My issue lies in the sensationalism and platforming of these theories touting by specific bad actors and pulling the families back in to experience the grief all over again. 

3/10 wouldn't recommend."

I watch something on ANY other stream service on my phone then switch to TV and there it is to continue watching. But when I do this with Netflix it has such a hard time updating... WHY? HOW IS IT THE ONLY SERVICE THAT FAILS AT THIS. I always switch between devices and when I do Netflix refuses to update unless I either restart the TV (unplug hard reset) or it freezes just trying to load up. Literally no other services has this problem for me it is all smooth and streamlined. How can arguably the biggest stream site not have this fixed by now? Just such a frustrating experience makes me wonder if their IT team is just fiddling their thumbs in some dark room forgotten by the company cause they don't give a shit. Insane I use 8 different streaming services and Netflix is the only one that fails at the most simplest thing.

The Apple TV remote was in the other room, visibly untouched. The TV clicks on and starts playing a YouTube video right when her phone pauses Netflix while displaying this error: “Error: Please use netflix app on TV.”

Joked about if his parents were transgender, joked about abortion and killing babies, joked about Jada Pinkett Smith, and joked about the Kardashians.

Then I started trying to stream some movies.  I noticed that every movie I streamed has a glitch every 30 seconds or so where the image skips, making any movie literally unwatchable. The odd thing is that this never occurred with the TV shows (such as Stranger Things). 

It's NOT my cable company, network, or device. It is ONLY the movies and not the TV shows, on Netflix streaming. So once I got caught up on the TV series I wanted to watch, ""Goodbye Netflix"". Glitching is going against everything I wanted to stream for.  I have been in their DVD program for over a decade, and satisfied with that.  Oddly enough, Netflix doesn't provide DVD options for their own productions! I'll stick with discs and HBO Max for now, thank you."

netflix,Selective Outrage - Chris Rock Slaps Back,"***“Selective Outrage” TKOs grievance culture, the celebrity of victimhood, and Will Smith’s “b\*\*\*\* s\*\*\*”***

In a world awash in wallowing, *Selective Outrage*, Rock’s latest stand-up tour de force, hits like a much needed slap across the face — in the case of Will Smith, quite literally.

*Selective Outrage* addresses the slap heard round the world with Rock’s characteristic blunt force directness, but the special is not simply a conduit through which Rock can laugh last and longest. His smackdown of the Smiths (Jada gets hers too) is worked organically into the larger tapestry of a fiery, incisive, and at times poignant rebuke of modern culture.

Rock wastes no time in establishing the state of play. He unpacks the special’s title right off the top.

&gt;*I have no problem with wokeness… I’m all for marginalized people getting their rights. The thing I have a problem with is the* ***selective outrage****… Like the kind of people that play Michael Jackson songs, but won’t play R. Kelly. Same crime. One of ’em just got better songs.*

The theme recurs throughout. Rock eviscerates corporate brands making hay off of the virality of social movements in their marketing while perpetuating economic equality in their business practices. He excoriates “motherf\*\*\*ers typing out woke ass tweets on a phone made by Chinese slaves.”

netflix,Chris Rock Dissapoints on “Selective Outrage”,"He had an opportunity to transcend comedy and become a legend, but instead he reminded us of why he was forgotten. He hit his ceiling decades ago, and became relevant again because someone else’s ceiling hit him. 

For all the pent up demand for his voice and comedy… Rock spent less than 8 minutes talking about what mattered. The rest was tired/recycled comedy from a comic long past his prime. 95% of his special had nothing to do about the slap. No one ever said you were a victim Rock… but in a more subtle and meaningful way… fate selected you to deliver for us a message. You failed in delivery. 

He had the platform to of course talk about stupid decisions people make…. but he could have also talked about healing, relationships, forgiveness, the very nature of our human condition and the folly of our lives. There’s incredible humor we can all relate to in that… 

I was honestly expecting more. A moment to bring us together. To laugh yeah at how crazy and stupid Will Smith is/was… but Will acted out of poorly misguided passion and an emasculated sense of self… all in a moment. Rock on the other hand had a whole year to construct a response and become bigger than that moment… the entire special was an ineffectual slap back that fell short of what fate set as an opportunity for Rock. 

Rock was born to an era of black/white jokes… and he showed little range beyond that school of comedy. Some things are worth fighting for… I just wish Rock knew to swing at this chance… rather than just be a weak comic still stuck in the glow of I’m Gonna Get You Sucka."
netflix,Complaint about Netflix Profiles,"Anyone else experience these two profile issues?

1) When Child A is mad at Child B, they can delete the Child B profile off of Netflix without the account password OR without the lock code. The only profile which cannot be deleted through the interface is the primary profile. 

2) I spend an hour locking down a profile to be age restricted and title restricted then realized that the child could just create a new profile on the profile selection screen, watch any title, R rated, X rated, etc AND because of their horrible UI (see item 1), they can simply delete the profile when done.

I reported both anomalies to support. After an hour of chatting, they finally understood my complaint only to say, there is nothing which can be done to correct this behavior."
netflix,Unveiling the Double Entendre in the Title of Netflix’s 'You',"Did you know that the title of the popular Netflix show 'You' is not just a simple pronoun? In fact, it's a clever double entendre that adds an extra layer of intrigue to the already gripping storyline.

As you follow the narrative of a stalker, the title takes on a new meaning. But what's even more fascinating is that when someone who doesn't know about the show asks what you are watching, your answer ""I am watching You"" can be interpreted in two ways - the show itself, or a personal implication. This dual interpretation is what makes the title so clever and a perfect double entendre, especially in the age of text messages and social media.

Join the conversation and let's discuss other examples of double entendres in popular culture!"

It all fell apart when I personally got the “Red” episode on number 4. With such a high budget show I never imagined there would be such bad acting, writing and directing in one 45+ minute episode. It’s inexplicable. There’s even a part where they are running to a boat and Espositos character LEAPS the 6 inches onto the jetty. Did they run out of money? Time? Fucks? It seems like everyone just sort of gave up on trying to make it watchable.

Though they talked about the SARS outbreak from China in 2003. I googled the episode air date and realised that it was aired in November 2019, just a month before the onset of COVID. 

There are signs everywhere of the next disastrous event which can happen, there are some people trying to spread awareness and prepare for these future events, but I feel general public only cares about these guidelines and information after the disaster strikes when it’s mostly too late and the damage has already been done. 

My takeaway after watching this episode was that we should be more careful and serious about the future disasters like climate change, environmental exploitation, new pandemics, wars, etc, and try to prepare ourselves for these situations from now itself."

I’m not sure if it’s suppose to load more when you get to the bottom but it’s not. My whole watch list loads on Netflix.com in a mobile web browser, which I would just use until it’s “fixed” but if you try to play in the mobile web browser it pushes you to download or use the app. Anyone else experience this or something similar ?"

netflix,Netflix (also HBO Max and Disney+) arent HD on PC,"So, for the longest time, more then a year probably, Ive had this issue. The shows I watch on Netflix simply arent the quality I pay for. I pay for 4k Ultra HD and on my PC I get very compressed 1080p or straight up 720p... And its only on my computer. Im not sure if its a network issue or some hardware stuff? My internet is great, more than enough to stream 4k quality, even if my computer isnt really 4k. I would be happy with a non compressed 1080p experience. Stuff like YouTube and Twitch absolutely allow me to watch stuff in proper HD, its just these subscription based streaming services that have this issue.  


Anyone had/has a similar issue? Ive tried contacting support to no avail..."
netflix,Has anyone seen Jonah Hill’s “Stutz” Documentary?,"I’ve been dealing with severe depression for most of my life, lots of family issues and personal stuff I won’t get into here. I stumbled upon this masterpiece today and had to take the time to shed some light on it and see how other people felt about it. If you haven’t seen it and deal with personal insecurity, depression, anxiety, etc. I’d highly recommend giving it a watch.

Stutz is a documentary following the ideas and life of Phil Stutz who also happens to be Jonah Hill’s psychiatrist. Phil isn’t your traditional psychiatrist in the sense that he doesn’t just listen and prescribe meds. He breaks the rules of traditional therapy by instead giving legitimate advice to his patients on how to take action and get control of their mind. In this documentary, Phil Stutz outlines his life and the practices he uses to help patients learn proper coping skills and how to regain or build passion and motivation. There are a plethora of useful “tools” he describes throughout the documentary and medication is rarely mentioned. 

My eyes were opened in a major way following my watch. Some of the things he talks about I’ve actually heard before, but thought of as nothing more than useless tactics that would only work on “normal people.” The way he explains them though is captivating and thought provoking, he normalized me in the way he spoke and for the first time made me genuinely feel like everyone is susceptible to what I’m going through mentally. The “tools” and concepts he provides the audience with are realistic, simple, and captivating. I’ve never felt more motivated and understanding of my own mind, as well as what prevents me from moving forward with life. 

Have you seen it? What are your thoughts on Phil Stutz and his ideas? How did it effect you?

TLDR: watch “Stutz” if you’re having issues coping with life, you may leave with a mindset that you never thought you could have."

Any idea how I can fix this or why it's happening?

For example avatar only shows me all seasons when I change the language settings to English. However by doing this you would expect English subtitles to always be available but I only get French on some anime. I do not speak French.

netflix,I'd like to see a limited TV series based on 60's and 70's Italian Giallo.,"Think Mario Bava and Dario Argento, etc as a few examples of directors. These are primarily slashers that have horror and detective aspects to it, as well as often themes of sex and motives of deviancy and sexploitation in the murders, as well as psychological drama/horror in the mix (to a lesser degree sometimes *perhaps* supernatural elements like in Phenomena).

For examples, think of Deep Red (1975), Bay of Blood (1971), Don't Torture a  Ducking (1972), Phenomena (1985), The Strange Vice of Mrs. Wardh  (1971),  All The Colors Of The Dark (1972),  Opera (1987), etc. as a few prime examples of this genre.

netflix,"Thoughts on ""Inside Man""","So I don't normally do this, but this is such an obscure mini series among my friend group that I have nobody to vent to otherwise. And I feel like I NEED to vent about this one. This will be full of spoilers, you've been warned.

Let me just say that I don't think every aspect of the show is bad. Performances, I think, are good. Dialog is acceptable. The core concept (at least, one side of it) is interesting. It's just that the plot is downright painful. It's like the writers just wrote in random contrivances to progress the plot, and did this multiple times every episode. I didn't even make it to the end, but by the time I stopped watching, I'd just roll my eyes whenever some new development happened instead of being shocked.

It starts with an interesting premise. Stanley Tucci is a former crim. professor and currently convicted murderer on death row somewhere in the American southwest. He solves crimes that the police otherwise don't touch or are unable to. Sure, cool. David Tennant is a vicar (priest I guess?) in England. Not sure how that factors in, but OK I like Tennant. Whatever.

This story has two sides - the Tucci side and the Tennant side. The Tucci side is fantastic. Good premise, fun dialog, interesting characters. The Tennant side is where, in my opinion, the story falls apart. It's just one random contrivance after another to back Tennant into a corner where he's left with ""no choice"" but to take the actions he does. Let me explain.

The first big confrontation that, I think, makes little sense is after the Tennant gets home from a day at his church. That day, he was handed a flash drive containing porn by one of his attendees. A clearly troubled, most likely mentally unwell boy. But he agrees to take the flash drive for safe keeping from the boy's puritanical mother, and not recommend the boy seek other forms of help. Because church, I guess? Anyway, he leaves the drive on a shelf in the entryway, where by coincidence his son grabs it to load some learning modules on from his math tutor. I think he hands the drive off to the tutor? The story's already getting a little hard to believe, but it's still within the realm of possibility.

The math tutor, Janice, quickly realizes what kind of porn is on the drive while she's moving files. The illegal kind. She calls Tennant over to the computer and confronts him about it, and Tennant starts to explain that it's not his. She jumps to the conclusion that it must be his son's, and he tries to deny it   
 and tells her it's a member of his church but can't say who it belong to. I assume because he made a promise before God and takes it VERY seriously. You know, more seriously than pedophilia. Good ol' Church!

So this is where things get even less believable. See, they try to circumvent the weirdness by having a prior scene where Janice is shown to be a bit of a weirdo loner who has a hero complex. She doesn't believe the Vicar at all, and acts very cagey. He repeatedly asks if she's going to tell the police as soon as she leaves, and she does a very bad job lying about it. Ultimately they get physical as she's trying to leave, and Tennant winds up pushing her down into his basement and locks the door behind her. The idea is that, in parallel with this, Tucci is telling the audience how it doesn't take much for a normal person to become a murderer. Tennant's story is supposed to be one such example, unbelievable as it is. 

My problem with this whole scene is that normal people don't act like that. I think most reasonable individuals would try and have a calm, rational discussion with someone who is clearly very trusted within the community, and claiming you're mistaken. Especially when the evidence is circumstantial at best. It just so happens that SHE is one of a handful of people on the fucking planet who'd act really awkward about it and immediately try and bolt to tell the police the version of the truth they're SURE must be true. Instead of, ya know, talking about it.

Obviously Tennant's character is also in the wrong for not just coming out and saying who the drive belongs to, but he's the Vicar of course. It's just another contrivance in the long list of contrivances to make this whole story possible.

As you can imagine, things keep spiraling out of control from there. The next big contrivance to move the plot along is that the boy who actually owns the porn, Edgar, suddenly has a 180 and vehemently denies ever owning it. Tennant tries to secretly record a conversation of him confessing to the ownership, but he has this big dramatic scene where he can't even say it in front of God. Further driving the Vicar into a corner and giving him ""no way out"". Also side note: did he not expect Tennant to see what was on the drive? I feel like people who deal in that stuff are way, way more careful. Then again, he's deeply mentally unwell and shown to be suicidal. How convenient! Gotta keep that plot rolling somehow! Also, is getting him to confess without him knowing somehow not breaking your vow? Seems very loophole-y to me. 

So now you've got a story with one woman who's probably on the spectrum and a boy with deep mental health issues, all coalescing around this deeply devout man of god who feels honor-bound to keep this boy's privacy...but only sometimes. By coincidence. And even then, the obvious solution is to just go the police at this point. If the boy is careless enough to hand unencrypted drives to people, he's probably got a digital paper trail on his home computer. Tenant's character apparently never even considers this possibility. There are just so, so many other obvious ways to resolve the situation that any normal person would think of. But he doesn't....to move the plot along.

I could keep going (and believe me, there are more), but I've already written enough. I made it the end of episode 3 as more and more of these contrivances stacked up to make the story ""work"" that it just became comical and unfun to watch.

I'm just curious if anyone else who's seen this one disagrees, or what they thought of it."

netflix,Netflix is Amazing because of this,"Netflix is amazing for cancelling Inside Job and keep renewing mediocre shows like Big Mouth or Aunt Chicago. Why? Because Netflix knows that quality is overrated and quantity is what matters. Netflix understands that people don't want to watch smart, witty and original shows like Inside Job that expose the dark secrets of the elite and make fun of conspiracy theories. No, people want to watch dumb, crude and repetitive shows like Big Mouth or Aunt Chicago that recycle the same jokes and stereotypes over and over again. Netflix cares about its customers so much that it doesn't want to challenge them or make them think too hard. Netflix wants to keep them entertained with mindless fluff that they can binge without paying attention. Netflix is amazing for cancelling Inside Job and keep renewing mediocre shows like Big Mouth or Aunt Chicago because Netflix is the ultimate troll that loves to disappoint its fans and ruin its reputation."
netflix,Netflix RENEW INSIDE JOB,"Inside Job is an American adult animated science fiction sitcom created by Shion Takeuchi for Netflix. It premiered on October 22, 2021 and received positive reviews for its writing, humor and voice acting. The show follows an awkward genius named Reagan Ridley who works at a secret organization that manages the world's conspiracies. She has to deal with her dysfunctional co-workers, her eccentric boss and her estranged father who may or may not be behind a global conspiracy. The show is witty, clever and full of hilarious references to pop culture, politics and conspiracy theories.

&amp;#x200B;

Big Mouth and Aunt Chicago are two other adult animated shows on Netflix that have been renewed for multiple seasons. Big Mouth is a crude comedy about puberty and sexuality that relies on gross-out humor, stereotypes and shock value. Aunt Chicago is a bland sitcom about a middle-aged woman who moves to Chicago with her niece and nephew after her husband dies. The show is predictable, boring and unfunny.

&amp;#x200B;

Netflix made a huge mistake by cancelling Inside Job after only one season while keeping Big Mouth and Aunt Chicago on its platform. Inside Job was a fresh and original show that had potential to become a cult classic. Big Mouth and Aunt Chicago are stale and uninspired shows that appeal to the lowest common denominator. Netflix should reconsider its decision and give Inside Job another chance to shine."

I just finished setting up and was surprised to discover that I am limited to one profile: mine. I can't create a profile for my son when he is at home. 

&amp;#x200B;

So either I let him watch on my profile and that means he can come across content that is too sensitive for him, or I have to change my profile to a child's profile and I can't watch my shows anymore.

Am I the one who doesn't quite understand? Or are we really limited to one profile when we are an extra member?

Quick question about Netflix and Samsung.

I have a 75Q80B (most recent software) that is having issues with netflix. I'll select Netflix from the Samsung apps and sometimes it works, sometimes it goes to a black screen and does nothing. Only solution I have is to go to the Samsung apps store and use the ""reinstall"" option. The netflix app itself hasn't been updated in 2 years according to the app details, not the tv details. 

Has anyone else come across this bug or know of a permanent solution?. Also, why is the app itself so old? Does Netflix not develop the software anymore? Is it ONLY Samsung's responsibility?."

netflix,"[tech help] MacOS - 4K for a few seconds, then dropping to 1080p","Hi everyone!

Not sure how to troubleshoot this one, so I'm asking for your help. I have an M1 16"" MacBook that started doing this weird thing—any UHD video starts at 4k, only to drop to 1080p a few seconds later. For example:

https://preview.redd.it/uvw5m892sdka1.png?width=3456&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=088ab6ecf8f295432bb12634b5fc8e968522dd84

I also have an AppleTV at home and that plays at 4K without any problems. I tested being connected straight to the fiber to internet converter and the problem persists. Tried [fast.com](https://fast.com) to make sure there was no throttling going on:

https://preview.redd.it/5w02g581tdka1.png?width=1858&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=3d7e3bf0c3b2530b2617ce19ce053fd44a54b06c

Do you have any clue what's going on here? It's so weird.

Thanks!"
netflix,Netflix Blocked the Wrong IP,"Netflix has blocked the wrong IP address and locked the paying party out of the account. 

I created an account for my parents and paid for a few years until they had Comcast take over the payments. I'm at a new address as well, so for some inexplicable reason, even though they're using the Comcast box that they're using to pay for Netflix, they've blocked my parent's access.

From what I'm seeing, there seems to be no way to change the primary location without a Smart TV (we have web, apps, set-top boxes with a different UI - but no Smart TV). 

I could go ahead and try to nuke the account, but I'm afraid the payment via Comcast could get looped in with said nuking.

Anyone have any idea what to do in this case? I don't care about retaining access for myself - I figured I'd get booted with the new rules - just want to transfer primary location IP to my parents and move on.

(This whole crackdown was done by the MBAs and in advance of the Product team doing the appropriate UX/UI work. Congrats on the Q1 crackdown folks. Real great work.)"

netflix,DVD service is going downhill - is it in a death spiral?,"I've been a DVD subscriber since 2006; might have been 2-at-a-time at some point, but mostly just one. Just looked at my history; 710 discs since June 2006 - about 1 every week.

I think we slowed down our actual watch rate when streaming started to take off 5-10 years ago, but lately we have been picking up the pace again, because there are fewer cinema-release movies on streaming that I want to watch - DVD is the only way to watch some. On Amazon Prime and Apple TV, I've also noticed that more cinema-released movies are rent or buy only.

So we have been paying more attention to the Netflix queue, but the last 4 discs I have received have had issues playing; Sully, Apollo 13, Bridge of Spies and Cloud Atlas. they all stopped at some point, and even after I cleaned the disc, we would have to skip forward and rewind to jump over the bad part of the disc without missing too much of the movie.

In the past if you reported a problem disc to Netflix they would usually dispatch the next one in your queue right away, but now you have to send the current one back first.

Yeah, I know, those movies are all 5-10 years old, or older, so I guess DVDs have a limited life-span when they are going in the mail to some people who don't handle them carefully. And they are not making many new copies of Apollo 13 I'm guessing, so it's not going to get replaced by Netflix.

I'm going to limit my choices to newer movies, post 2015, in the hope I will get better quality discs, but I'm not optimistic. Maybe take my $8 per month and start buying my own copies.

Any DVD subscribers have similar stories?"

I know the jury is supposed to avoid all media but in this day and age that’s a difficult thing to do.

It is very hard to find a genre, category, date range, etc. of anything. For example, if I want to watch Film Noir from 1940-1950, there is no easy way to generate a list. But that is SO easy. Or Sci-Fi, 1977-1990.

Must have been released in the 70s or 80s could be early 90s too. Thank you in advance."

Then a certain character get killed off and the show changed on season 2.  I didn't like start of season 2 and decided to give up i watched 2 or 3 episodes.  Seems like some of the main characters become so 1 dimensional I just didn't like it anymore.

I loved glow for 18 episodes.  In liked it better than Ozark season 1 it was so fun.  Then episode 19 the show changed drastically became a lot more positive vibes, no conflicts,  and in the start of season 3 seems like wrestling isn't even an important aspect of the show anymore.

netflix,Question about payment,"Tldr: moving from India to Ireland, will i still be paying the Indian price (Rs 650/€7.36) or Irish one (€21)?

Hi! so for context I'm currently residing in India and will be moving to Ireland next month, so while prepping for the big move i decided to check out the Irish plans and saw that it was around €21 which i was fine with paying but then after some more browsing i found sites saying that Netflix is bound to the country where the account was created so I'll be charged the same (Rs 650/€7.36). 

Now this seems too good to be true because I'll be saving a lot in the long run so i tried seeing if the official site has a post about this but all i got was that the catalogue will be different (which i don't really care about) and slight change in prices. 

Would appreciate it if anyone can help out as I've tried searching here on reddit too, but the posts were mostly about switching to the payment of the country the person would be moving to. Thanks! 


Additional info: I'll be having a debit card from India which Netflix can auto deduct the payment from."

netflix,My biggest problem with sea beast:,"&amp;#x200B;

[I'm not joking](https://i.redd.it/j476mj3d1hja1.gif)

Look, I can see what you were trying to do, I can see what you were trying to say, and I'd say you did both fairly well... but you've run into the trap I've seen so many shows and movies fall into these days, especially animated movies. They want to subvert what you thought the story would be and actually make it about a deeper message of some kind, or have it more complicated in an attempt to make it more interesting. This worked for How to train your dragon, and it's excellent because of it. But I feel it really didn't work for sea beast and the biggest reason why I think that is because of the story they planned to subvert.

The opening scene of sea beast was really well done and the introduction of the kid character was actually handled pretty well. It was set up to be a story about legacy and the story we must carve out for ourselves, all while hunting a mythical beast that had driven the old captain to crazed obsession. That's extremely interesting I wonder how- it's Httyd now yay. Seriously the exact moment I saw the red blusters design I knew exactly what this film was: 

[The large rounded teeth and smooth skin gave it away](https://preview.redd.it/c6s73olv2hja1.png?width=1284&amp;format=png&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=02f7a9acfc41a0d57c5443fb81317b96623e31ed)

And this leads to the point of this post... there's nothing wrong with simple. I know everyone wants to rock the world and show a whole new way to tell old stories but that's not necessarily needed. This story in my mind took a nose dive as soon as it became httyd, and though by the end it pulled its head out of the water again... honestly it should be higher up out of the water.

Moral of the story: There's nothing wrong with simple"

netflix,Picture quality,"Has anyone noticed a change in picture quality? I have noticed a downgrade in picture quality for about 2 years now. This is not only Netflix but cable TV too. Whenever they play a movie or TV series the picture is in standard quality but when it's live TV (like the news, sports, talk show) the picture is in HD quality. I have noticed this change everywhere and nobody seems to have noticed. It's not my TV because as I've said it is not every program. It seems movies and TV shows are broadcasted and streamed on standard quality now even when your settings are in HD. Just wondering if anyone else has noticed this problem. I haven't been able to watch a movie in decent quality in years. I have my favorite movies on Blu-Ray (and I definitely see a difference there) but that's obviously not enough/convenient."

netflix,"Sharing accounts, can the second profile also receive notification emails?","So my mom and I share an account. She gets regular emails about new shows, but also which shows on her to watch list will be leaving Netflix soon.

Is it possible for my profile to also receive these emails? Knowing when a show that's on my list is about to get taken off seems super useful!

I already looked at our account page, but didn't really see this option on my phone."

netflix,My thoughts on Re/member (no spoilers),"It's a horror version of Groundhog's Day, but sadly there's just too much schoolgirl romantic antics for my liking. They should've delved more into the background of the red girl, her motivations, what happened to her etc. Or conversely leaned into the groundhog's day aspect and do a full Bill Murray character growth scenario. Instead, half the show is high school girl making googly eyes at her crush. 

Overall 6/10, this movie had tons of potential, most of it wasted. There's an after credits scene, but it's a bit confusing."
netflix,shows to watch kid at home,I've been home with a terrible virus and am finally ready to enjoy some TV. Since I've been going to bed early I would like to watch something during the day. My 10 year old largely manages herself but often comes in to say hi. I like mysteries and noir but many are violent. Any tips for something that is good and wouldn't be offensive?
